# SyobonActionMono
Syobon Action original source from author's Geocities site converted to MonoGame (Previously XNA)

I converted this code which was originally C(guessing) to C# with XNA. This was obtained from the author's Geocities webstie known as http://www.geocities.com/z_gundam_tanosii. After I converted to XNA, I contacted the author to let him know its been translated over. At the time, he was looking for a language translator for Eryi Action and thought that's what I meant. I sent him the source code in case he wanted to release the original on some Microsoft Platform. In order to preserve things, I figured I would go ahead and conver the XNA source to MonoGame. As you can tell, my conversion was a MVS just to get the game running. A lot of the messages have been converted because my font showed the Japanese fonts as ASCII garbage.
